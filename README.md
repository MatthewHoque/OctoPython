# **Project Abandoned**

### Initial purpose was for secure remote interfacing with octoprint. Ended up using an alternative to a Raspberry Pi, the libre AML-S905X-CC SBC to host nginx and reverse proxy a through a personal domain with SSL encryption to get the full hosted interface along with a camera feed. Much more functional and fluid.
